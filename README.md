Even-odd:

The num variable takes an integer input from the user

if the remainder is 0 after dividing with 2, then it is even

else it is odd


Sum to 50:

taking a variable a as 0 so that it will not change the result of the addition

taking range(1,51) as we want the range to be uptill 50

the addition of all the numbers in range(1,51) occours in the for loop
